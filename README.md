# go-adaptive-cards

Go package for creating adaptive cards in Go.

## Purpose

Adaptive cards are JSON and can be very complex. Operating raw JSON is unconvinient, so this packages allows to build cards in Golang. Then they can be converted to JSON, filling in types and validating required fields. More on adaptive cards: https://adaptivecards.io/.

## Usage

Import package:

```go
import (
    cards "github.com/DanielTitkov/go-adaptive-cards"
)
```
And define your card:

```go
c := cards.New([]cards.Node{
    &cards.Container{
        Items: []cards.Node{
            &cards.TextBlock{
                Text:     "foo",
                IsSubtle: cards.FalsePtr(),
            },
        },
    },
}, []cards.Node{}).
    WithSchema(cards.DefaultSchema).
    WithVersion(cards.Version12)

s, err := c.StringIndent("", "    ")
```

This will give you JSON that you can use with bot framework and so on: 

```json
{
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "version": "1.2",
    "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
    "body": [
        {
            "type": "Container",
            "items": [
                {
                    "type": "TextBlock",
                    "text": "foo",
                    "isSubtle": false
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Limitations

* As yet package does not validate string values except for types (e.g. "bolder" for text weight). Look for supported values in adaptive cards [schema explorer](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/).
* Not all card attributes are supported by the constructor. By now you can define a card as struct in order to access all attributes.
* Some fields can be both a JSON object or a string (e.g. Inlines of the RichTextBlock). This is not supported. Such field can only be provided as structs.
